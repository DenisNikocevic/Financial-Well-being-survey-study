# Introduction
<details>
  <summary>Key facts and proposed hypothesis</summary>
  
•The survey that I have analyzed for my project was developed in 2017 by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.<br/>

•The total number of respondents in the survey is 6,394, with the main study being fielded in late 2016.<br/>

•The main hypothesis that i will be testing in my research is that financial literacy is a better predictor of financial well being than income.<br/>

# Key dependent variable
<details>
  <summary>Financial well being</summary>
  
The key dependent variable that I will be observing is the Financial well being score.<br/>

Developed by the CFPB with the help of experts and consumers.<br/>


Represented as a number between 0-100, the scale does not have a clear cut-off point for good and bad scores, and extreme values are rare.<br/>
