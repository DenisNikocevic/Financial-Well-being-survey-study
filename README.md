  <summary>Key facts and proposed hypothesis</summary>
  
•The survey that I have analyzed for my project was developed in 2017 by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

•The total number of respondents in the survey is 6,394, with the main study being fielded in late 2016.

•The main hypothesis that i will be testing in my research is that financial literacy is a better predictor of financial well being than income.

# Key dependent variable

  <summary>Financial well being</summary>
  
The key dependent variable that I will be observing is the Financial well being score.

Developed by the CFPB with the help of experts and consumers.


Represented as a number between 0-100, the scale does not have a clear cut-off point for good and bad scores, and extreme values are rare.
